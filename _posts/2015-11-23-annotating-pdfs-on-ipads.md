In my continuing quest for greater efficient, I recently went back to an approach that I tried and abandoned before: to annotate a PDF on an iPad using an electronic pen. This time I had a much better iPad (an iPad Air), a much better pen (the [Jot Dash](http://www.adonit.net/jot/dash/)), and a much better app for annotations ([Notability](http://www.gingerlabs.com)). It all worked, but I’m not sure if it was the most efficient approach in terms of time use.

The experience was pleasant enough. Notability is a great application, and the Jot Dash – with a much finer point than the pens I’ve tried before – worked very well. The procedure was simple: put the PDF in Dropbox on my computer, import the PDF from Dropbox in Notability on the iPad, annotate, then upload the annotated result to Dropbox and open it again on my laptop. I was pleased that I could read the result in Acrobat: there were no issues that I could see with the annotations produced on the iPad.

However, I think it didn’t save me any time over what it would have taken to do annotations in Acrobat directly on my laptop.  I think the ability to read the PDF on an iPad and use a pen gave it all an air of familiarity, like using real paper held in my hands and writing on it with a pen, but I had to rewrite some things to make my writing on the iPad more legible, and writing by hand for me is slower than typing. If I had used Acrobat annotations in the usual way, I am sure I would have been able to enter the information more quickly. Even things like circling something or pointing to something in the text with a line and arrow could be done in Acrobat, so there are no real limitations of using Acrobat for adding basic comments on a paper. Plus, there is additional time wasted in putting the document into Dropbox, downloading it to the iPad app, and then uploading the result to Dropbox.

Now, compared with another the alternative of writing on real paper with a real pen and then scanning the result, I suspect the virtual paper & pen approach is more efficient overall. First, you can erase and change your annotations (which is messier with pen on paper, and in the long run can lead to more time wasted on clarifying the results with whoever you’re sending the feedback to), and second, you don’t have to do a scanning step, which can take some time and be frustrating even if you have portable scanner with you.

The part that is difficult to quantify is whether using the tablet and being able to use that more familiar and intuitive method (virtual pen on paper) let me think more deeply or even just differently from when I am reading a PDF on a laptop. That in itself might be worth the time wasted due to the inefficiencies of the process.

So in a nutshell: the approach is slower for me at this point, but being able to treat the PDF almost as a paper in my hand and use a virtual pen may have some advantages that can’t be obtained by typing comments on a laptop.
