For one of the projects I’m working on, we need comprehensive lists of programming languages, software licenses, and several other software-related topics. We could not find any existing single sources that were comprehensive enough. Wikipedia has a large number of pages about languages, it’s true, but it’s not complete. (Our project has been mining GitHub repositories and we found many others.)

Faced with this need, we had to create our own lists as start points, but we can’t hope to build up or maintain these lists solely ourselves. This is a case where we need community participation.

For this reason, I started two projects on GitHub:

* [SoManyLanguages](https://github.com/mhucka/SoManyLanguages)
* [SoManyLicenses](https://github.com/mhucka/SoManyLanguages)

They are both similar in using plain old Markdown tables to provide the data, and GitHub’s slick facilities for [fork/pull/propose changes](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) make it super simple and easy for anyone to propose an update to the lists. And it’s been working – people have already contributed updates.

So please go over and help flesh out the lists! Even a simple link addition is enough to get your name into the list of committers/contributors :-).
