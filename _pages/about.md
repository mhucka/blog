I'm a member of the Caltech [Digital Library Development](https://www.library.caltech.edu) group and have been working on ways to improve the preservation of knowledge and scientific data.  My interests include extraction and preservation of knowledge, handwritten text recognition, artificial intelligence, simulation, systems biology, and cognitive science.

After beginning my career first in artificial intelligence and computational neuroscience, I shifted to systems biology in the late 1990s.  In collaboration with a [superb team](http://sbml.org/About) of computational scientists and international collaborators, I codeveloped the most widely-used format for exchanging computational models in systems biology, [SBML](http://sbml.org) (the Systems Biology Markup Language), as well as [MIRIAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt1156) (Minimal Information Requested in the Annotation of Models), [BioModels.net](http://biomodels.net), the Systems Biology Graphical Notation [SBGN](http://sbgn.org), the Systems Biology Ontology [SBO](http://biomodels.net/sbo), and I helped start [BioModels Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/). To help support community standards in computational biology, I cofounded [COMBINE](http://co.mbine.org) (the Computational Modeling in Biology Network).  Separately, I have also worked on [systems for finding software](http://casics.org).

Earlier in my career, I co-developed the first version of [NeuroML](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/356/1412/1209.short), maintained (for a time) the [GENESIS](http://www.genesis-sim.org) simulation system, worked on cognitive science in the group of [Stephen Kaplan](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~skap/), and worked in the group of [John Laird](http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/laird/index.html) on applying  the [Soar](http://soar.eecs.umich.edu) cognitive architecture to robotics.

When not in front of a computer or spending time with family and friends, I enjoy [photography](http://mikehucka.smugmug.com), skiing, and scuba diving.
